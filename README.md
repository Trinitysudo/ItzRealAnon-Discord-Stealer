## Overview

   This is a single made project by sincerly myself it is written in python only, i did not steal or fork any code in this so this has taken a extreme amount
of time and if you are willing PLEASE share your ideas, im so out of ideas/inspiration i cant think of what to add to this amazing project. This was just a tool for fun to see how far i could 
get and after finishing the code ive made this is a hobby, i really enjoy coding this and i plan to keep doing that fixing bugs and updating it on the regular thanks enjoy.
